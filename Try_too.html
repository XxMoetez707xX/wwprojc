<p id="AC">I noticed that people usually forget about their mailbox especially workers
     until it is too late so we thought about developing an alerting system that notifies the users about each mail,
      letter or bills received,Using an electronic programmed device, a defined algorithm and the adequate sensor.
       The process is, briefly, an optic sensor going to detect the mail that felt down in the mailbox , 
      The processor will send immediately an email to the user using network.</p>
